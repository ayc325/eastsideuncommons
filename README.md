# Angela's Eastside Uncommons

## How to run the code

* Compile with `javac *.java`
* Setup if any changes with `jar cvfm Enterprise.jar Manifest.txt *.class`
* Run with `java -jar Enterprise.jar`


## Assumptions

1. No Pets: Many properties in real life do not allow pets due to property damage so my Eastside Uncommons also does not allow pets to keep costs low.
2. Move-out Date: All move-out dates are 12 months out from move-in date. Move-in date is the current date and that actively changes depending on when you run the code. For this reason, there is no manual set-move out date.
3. No Inflation: Usually, property managers will increase rent and security deposit after a tenant moves out to account for inflation but for the simplicity of the project, I will not be considering inflation.
4. Apartment Buildings only: Properties are the Apartment Building itself and Apartments = apartment units so you cannot add apartments unless you add a new property. The company only invests in apartment buildings in cities.
5. All monthly charges from amenities are always included in full so tenants do not have the option to opt-out of amenity fees
6. We assume that tenants have enough money for rent since in real life, property managers cannot check tenants' bank accounts.
